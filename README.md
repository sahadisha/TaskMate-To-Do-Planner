# 📝 TaskMate – Daily To-Do App

TaskMate is a lightweight **daily task management app** built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  
It allows users to select a date, add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them — all while persisting data locally in the browser using **Local Storage**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📅 **Daily View** – Manage tasks for a specific date.
- ✅ **Task Completion** – Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- ❌ **Delete Tasks** – Remove tasks instantly.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Tasks remain saved in **Local Storage**, even after refresh.
- 🕒 **Timezone Safe** – Fixed the common "one day late" issue caused by UTC vs local time conversion.
